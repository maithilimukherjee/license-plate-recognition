1. canny
canny is an edge detection algorithm.
- what canny actually does (simple words)
- noise reduction (gaussian blur)
- gradient calculation (finds intensity change)
- non-maximum suppression (thins edges)
- double thresholding (strong vs weak edges)
- edge tracking by hysteresis (connects real edges)

when we do:

edges = cv2.Canny(gray_filtered, 30, 200)

30 → lower threshold
200 → upper threshold

license plates have strong rectangular edges
canny highlights those edges clearly
perfect for contour detection next

2. subplot concept
subplot = showing multiple images in one window
plt.subplot(1,3,1)

means:
1 row
3 columns

this is the 1st image
so:
plt.subplot(1,3,1) → original image
plt.subplot(1,3,2) → grayscale
plt.subplot(1,3,3) → edges

why this is useful:
you visually compare each preprocessing stage
debugging becomes easy
helps in reports & ppt screenshots
