1. canny
canny is an edge detection algorithm.
- what canny actually does (simple words)
- noise reduction (gaussian blur)
- gradient calculation (finds intensity change)
- non-maximum suppression (thins edges)
- double thresholding (strong vs weak edges)
- edge tracking by hysteresis (connects real edges)

when we do:

edges = cv2.Canny(gray_filtered, 30, 200)

30 → lower threshold
200 → upper threshold

license plates have strong rectangular edges
canny highlights those edges clearly
perfect for contour detection next

logic flow:

edges
  ↓
find contours
  ↓
filter by area
  ↓
approximate polygon
  ↓
select rectangle (4 corners)
  ↓
extract plate region

character segmentation pipeline:

plate image
   ↓
grayscale
   ↓
thresholding (binary image)
   ↓
morphological ops (clean noise)
   ↓
find contours
   ↓
filter contours by size
   ↓
extract characters

character segmentation isolates individual alphanumeric symbols from the license plate using thresholding and contour analysis.
